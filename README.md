Ansible Book
=========================

This is an open source ansible book project. You can download PDF version of the book from under root directory called **Automation with Ansible.pdf**


Our approach of writing this book is to make it stable and good enough for any one who wants to start Ansible. From there on we want to improve and add new chapters in future, which also means anyone who want to write a chapter, or make a correction is welcome to do so. Therefore initial version will only contain several chapters, and we will try our best to add new chapters and make corrections.


#Contributions
Contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated. If you like to write a chapter or make corrections please do it without hesitation. We are very happy for pull requests.


#Examples
Examples that are given in this book are in the */source-code/* folder.
